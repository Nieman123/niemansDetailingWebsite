          <h2 id="works-overview">What This Service Covers</h2>
          <p>The Works is the most complete interior and exterior detail package from Nieman's Detailing, designed to
            reset a vehicle in one appointment with deep interior cleaning, wheel and tire care, engine bay detailing,
            careful paint-safe washing, and premium paint protection. It is built for drivers in Asheville, Weaverville,
            and Hendersonville who want one thorough mobile detailing visit that handles heavy buildup and leaves the
            vehicle looking, feeling, and smelling dramatically cleaner.</p>

        <section class="service-section" aria-labelledby="works-when">
          <h2 id="works-when">When You Might Need The Works</h2>
          <p>This package is usually the right choice when it has been several months since the last professional
            detail, after road trips or seasonal weather has added grime and contamination, or before selling or trading
            in the vehicle. It is also the best starting point for first-time clients, because beginning with a full
            detail makes future maintenance washes faster, more affordable, and more effective.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="service-section" aria-labelledby="works-benefits">
          <h2 id="works-benefits">Why It Is Worth Doing</h2>
          <p>A full mobile detail protects long-term vehicle value by reducing paint wear, slowing UV and contamination
            damage, and keeping interior materials from drying, staining, or holding odors. Beyond appearance,
            consistent full detailing improves comfort and pride of ownership, helps preserve resale value, and gives
            you a clean baseline so future detailing and protection services perform better.</p>
